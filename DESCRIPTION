Description: This package has been created with an aim to generate and optimize
             field experiments.
Details: Initial and Optimal experimental designs are generated
    considering both genetic and spatial correlations simulatenaously. "A" or "D"
    optimality criteria are employed together with a swap (interchange) algorithm in
    the context of Linear Mixed Models.
Note: For the RCB designs, blocks are considered fixed and treatments
    (genotypes) are random effects. For the incomplete, unequal and augmented designs,
    both blocks and treatments are random effects, with only the intercept being
    a fixed effect.
